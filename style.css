/*
CSS tells the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. Allows you to control:
color
fonts
positioning
spacing
sizing
decorations
transitions

There are three main ways to apply CSS styling.
    1.) You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute.
        <h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
    2.) Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document.
        <style>
          h2 {color: red;}
        </style>
    3.*) Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document.

Class names in CSS stylesheets begin with a period
    <style>
      .blue-text {
        color: blue;
      }
    </style>
